  // Some tasks below are configured to run in the ${cwd} or current working
  // directory. This is usually the root of your VS Code workspace, the folder
  // you opened, also known as ${workspaceFolder}. If you have many different
  // projects inside the same workspace and each is in its own sub-directory,
  // and you only work on one project at a time, it is convenient to change your
  // ${cwd} to the specific sub-directory you're working in. That way, when you
  // open a new terminal it will be in the folder of the current project. In
  // settings, search for "terminal cwd" for how to change it.
